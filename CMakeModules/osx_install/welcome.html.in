    <h1>Welcome To ArrayFire ${AF_VERSION}</h1>

    <p>
    ArrayFire is a high performance software library for parallel computing
    with an easy-to-use API. Its <em>array</em> based function set makes parallel
    programming simple.
    </p>

    <p> 
    ArrayFire's multiple backends (<strong>CUDA</strong>,
    <strong>OpenCL</strong>and native <strong>CPU</strong>) make it platform
    independent and highly portable.
    </p>

    <p>
    A few lines of code in ArrayFire can replace dozens of lines of parallel
    compute code, saving you valuable time and lowering development costs.
