## Reporting Issues ##

We value your feedback about issues you encounter. The more information you
provide the easier it is for developers to resolve the problem.

Issues should be reported to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/issues?state=open).

Issues can also be used to submit feature requests.

## Submitting Pull Requests ##

Base your changes on `master` but submit your pull-request to `devel`. This
can be changed by clicking the "Edit" button on the pull-request page. The
devel branch is used for integration and testing of changes before merging
into the stable `master` branch.

Please try to rebase your changes on the current master branch before
submitting. This keeps the git history cleaner and easier to understand.

If you are adding a new feature, please add unit tests for the new function. If you are unfamiliar with GoogleTest framework, you can follow the guidelines [here](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Writing-Unit-Tests) to write unit tests.
