# - Find ArrayFire

# Defines the following variables:
# ArrayFire_INCLUDE_DIRS    - Location of ArrayFire's include directory.
# ArrayFire_LIBRARIES       - Location of ArrayFire's libraries. This will default
#                             to a GPU backend if one is found.
# ArrayFire_FOUND           - True if ArrayFire has been located
#
# You may provide a hint to where ArrayFire's root directory may be located
# by setting ArrayFire_ROOT_DIR before calling this script.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ArrayFire_CPU_FOUND        - True of the ArrayFire CPU library has been found.
# ArrayFire_CPU_LIBRARIES    - Location of ArrayFire's CPU library, if found
# ArrayFire_CUDA_FOUND       - True of the ArrayFire CUDA library has been found.
# ArrayFire_CUDA_LIBRARIES   - Location of ArrayFire's CUDA library, if found
# ArrayFire_OpenCL_FOUND     - True of the ArrayFire OpenCL library has been found.
# ArrayFire_OpenCL_LIBRARIES - Location of ArrayFire's OpenCL library, if found
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and
# need to be set before calling find_package:
