ArrayFire is a general-purpose library that simplifies the process of developing
software that targets parallel and massively-parallel architectures including
CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware acceleration devices.

Several of ArrayFire's benefits include:

* [Easy to use](http://arrayfire.org/docs/gettingstarted.htm), stable,
  [well-documented](http://arrayfire.org/docs) API
* Rigorously tested for performance and accuracy
* Commercially friendly open-source licensing
* Commercial support from [ArrayFire](http://arrayfire.com)
* [Read about more benefits on arrayfire.com](http://arrayfire.com/the-arrayfire-library/)

ArrayFire provides software developers with a high-level
abstraction of data which resides on the accelerator, the `af::array` object.
Developers write code which performs operations on ArrayFire arrays which, in turn,
are automatically translated into near-optimal kernels that execute on the computational
device.

ArrayFire is successfully used on devices ranging from low-power mobile phones
to high-power GPU-enabled supercomputers. ArrayFire runs on CPUs from all
major vendors (Intel, AMD, ARM), GPUs from the prominent manufacturers
(NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm), as well as a variety of other accelerator devices
on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Installation

You can install the ArrayFire library from one of the following ways:

#### Official installers

Execute one of our [official binary installers](https://arrayfire.com/download)
for Linux, OSX, and Windows platforms.

#### Build from source

Build from source by following instructions on our
[wiki](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki).

## Examples

The following examples are simplified versions of
[`helloworld.cpp`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/tree/devel/examples/helloworld/helloworld.cpp)
and
[`conway_pretty.cpp`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/tree/devel/examples/graphics/conway_pretty.cpp),
respectively. For more code examples, visit the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/tree/devel/examples)
directory.

#### Hello, world!

```cpp
array A = randu(5, 3, f32); // Create 5x3 matrix of random floats on the GPU
array B = sin(A) + 1.5;     // Element-wise arithmetic
array C = fft(B);           // Fourier transform the result

float d[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
array D(2, 3, d, afHost);   // Create 2x3 matrix from host data
D.col(0) = D.col(end);      // Copy last column onto first

array vals, inds;
sort(vals, inds, A);        // Sort A and print sorted array and corresponding indices
af_print(vals);
af_print(inds);
```

#### Conway's Game of Life

Visit the
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for a
description of Conway's Game of Life.

```cpp
static const float h_kernel[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1};
static const array kernel(3, 3, h_kernel, afHost);

array state = (randu(128, 128, f32) > 0.5).as(f32); // Generate starting state
Window myWindow(256, 256);
while(!myWindow.close()) {
  array nHood = convolve(state, kernel); // Obtain neighbors
  array C0 = (nHood == 2);               // Generate conditions for life
  array C1 = (nHood == 3);
  state = state * C0 + C1;               // Update state
  myWindow.image(state);                 // Display
}

```
