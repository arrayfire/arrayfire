## ArrayFire Test Data

ArrayFire is a High Performance software library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. Its **array** based function set makes parallel programming simple.

ArrayFire's multiple backends (**CUDA**, **OpenCL** and native **CPU**) make it platform independent and highly portable.

A few lines of code in ArrayFire can replace dozens of lines of parallel computing code, saving you valuable time and lowering development costs.

This repository contains the test data used for testing ArrayFire
