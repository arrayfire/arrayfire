\page image_func_hsv HSV

HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, brightness),
is often used by artists because it is more natural to think about a color in
terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color
components (as in RGB). HSV is a transformation of RGB colorspace; its
components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB colorspace from which it was
derived. Like RGB, HSV also uses 3 values per pixel.

\page image_func_rgb RGB

RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the most common format used in computer imaging. RGB
stores individual values for red, green and blue, and hence the 3 values per
pixel. A combination of these three values produces the gamut of unique colors.

\page image_func_gray GRAY

Grayscale is a single channel color space where pixel value ranges from 0 to 1.
Zero represents black, one represent white and any value between zero & one is
a gray value

\defgroup image_func_histogram histogram
\ingroup hist_mat

\brief Histogram of input data

A histogram is a representation of the distribution of given data. This
representation is essentially a graph consisting of the data range or domain on
one axis and frequency of occurence on the other axis. All the data in the
domain is counted in the appropriate bin. The total number of elements
belonging to each bin is known as the bin's frequency.

The regular histogram function creates bins of equal size between the minimum
and maximum of the input data (min and max are calculated internally). The histogram min-max
function takes input parameters minimum and maximum, and divides the bins into
equal sizes within the range specified by min and max parameters. All values
less than min in the data range are placed in the first (min) bin and all
values greater than max will be placed in the last (max) bin.

A component is defined as one or more nonzero pixels that are connected by
the specified connectivity (either 4-way(\ref AF_CONNECTIVITY_4) or
8-way(\ref AF_CONNECTIVITY_8)) in two dimensions.

\defgroup image_func_gauss gaussiankernel
\ingroup utility_mat

\brief Creates a Gaussian Kernel

This function creates a kernel of a specified size that contains a Gaussian
distribution. This distribution is normalized to one. This is most commonly
used when performing a Gaussian blur on an image. The function takes two sets
of arguments, the size of the kernel (width and height in pixels) and the
sigma parameters (for row and column) which effect the distribution of the
weights in the y and x directions, respectively.

Changing sigma causes the weights in each direction to vary. Sigma is calculated
internally as (0.25 * rows + 0.75) for rows and similarly for columns.

\brief Meanshift Filter

A meanshift filter is an edge-preserving smoothing filter commonly used in object
tracking and image segmentation.

This filter replaces each pixel in the image with the mean of the values within a
given given color and spatial radius. The meanshift filter is an iterative algorithm
that continues until a maxium number of iterations is met or until the value of the
means no longer changes.

\defgroup image_func_bilateral bilateral
\ingroup imageflt_mat

\brief Bilateral Filter

A bilateral filter is a edge-preserving filter that reduces noise in an image.
The intensity of each pixel is replaced by a weighted average of the intensities
of nearby pixels. The weights follow a Gaussian distribution and depend on the
distance as well as the color distance.

The bilateral filter requires the size of the filter (in pixels) and the upper
bound on color values, N, where pixel values range from 0â€“N inclusively.

\defgroup image_func_erode erode
\ingroup morph_mat

\brief Erosion(morphological operator) for images

The erosion function is a morphological transformation on an image that requires two inputs.
The first is the image to be morphed, and the second is the mask indicating neighborhood that
must be white in order to preserve each pixel.

In erode, for each pixel, the mask is centered at the pixel. If each pixel of the mask matches
the corresponding pixel on the image, then no change is made. If there is at least one mismatch,
then pixels are changed to the background color (black).

For further reference, see: [Erosion (morphology)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_(morphology))

Sample input and output are shown below:

\brief Dilation(morphological operator) for images

The dilation function takes two pieces of data as inputs. The first is the input image to be

In dilation, for each pixel, the mask is centered at the pixel. If the center pixel of the
mask matches the corresponding pixel on the image, then the mask is accepted. If the center
pixels do not matches, then the mask is ignored and no changes are made.

\defgroup transform_func_resize resize

Resize an input image

Resizing an input image can be done using either \ref AF_INTERP_NEAREST or
\ref AF_INTERP_BILINEAR interpolations. Nearest interpolation will pick the
nearest value to the location, whereas bilinear interpolation will do a
weighted interpolation for calculate the new size.

This function does not differentiate between images and data. As long as
the array is defined and the output dimensions are not 0, it will resize any
type or size of array.

\defgroup transform_func_rotate rotate
\ingroup transform_mat

Rotate an input image

The angle theta is in radians.

Rotating an input image can be done using either \ref AF_INTERP_NEAREST or
\ref AF_INTERP_BILINEAR interpolations. Nearest interpolation will pick the
nearest value to the location, whereas bilinear interpolation will do a
weighted interpolation for calculate the new size.

This function does not differentiate between images and data. As long as
the array is defined, it will rotate any type or size of array.

The crop option allows you to choose whether to resize the image.
If crop is set to false, ie. the entire rotated image will be a part of the
array and the new array size will be greater than or equal to the input array
size.
If crop is set to true, then the new array size is same as the input array
size and the data that falls outside the boundaries of the array is discarded.

Any location of the rotated array that does not map to a location of the input
array is set to 0.


\defgroup transform_func_translate translate
\ingroup transform_mat

Translate an input image

Translating an image is moving it along 1st and 2nd dimensions by \p trans0
and \p trans1. Positive values of these will move the data towards negative x
and negative y whereas negative values of these will move the positive right
and positive down. See the example below for more.

To specify an output dimension, use the \p odim0 and odim1 for dim0 and dim1
respectively. The size of 2rd and 3rd dimension is same as input.
If \p odim0 and odim1 and not defined, then the output dimensions are same as
the input dimensions and the data out of bounds will be discarded.

All new values that do not map to a location of the input array are set to 0.

Translate is a special case of the \ref af::transform function.

\defgroup transform_func_scale scale
\ingroup transform_mat

Scale an input image

Scale is the same functionality as \ref af::resize except that the scale function uses
the transform kernels. The other difference is that scale does not set boundary
values to be the boundary of the input array. Instead these are set to 0.

Scale is a special case of the \ref af::transform function.


\defgroup transform_func_skew skew
\ingroup transform_mat

Skew an input image

Skew function skews the input array along dim0 by \p skew0 and along dim1 by
\p skew1. The skew areguments are in radians.
Skewing the data means the data remains parallel along 1 dimensions but the
other dimensions gets moved along based on the angle.
If both \p skew0 and \p skew1 are specified, then the data will be skewed
along both directions.

Explicit output dimensions can be specified using \p odim0 and \p odim1.

All new values that do not map to a location of the input array are set to 0.

Skew is a special case of the \ref af::transform function.


\defgroup transform_func_transform transform
\ingroup transform_mat

Transform an input image

The transform function uses an affine transform matrix to tranform an input
image into a new one.

The transform matrix \p tf is a 3x2 matrix of type float. The matrix operation
is applied to each location (x, y) that is then transformed to (x', y') of the
new array. Hence the transformation is an element-wise operation.

The operation is as below:
tf = [r00 r10
      r01 r11
      t0  t1]

x' = x * r00 + y * r01 + t0;
y' = x * r10 + y * r11 + t1;

Interpolation types of \ref AF_INTERP_NEAREST and \ref AF_INTERP_BILINEAR are allowed.

Affine transforms can be used for various purposes. \ref af::translate, \ref af::scale and \ref af::skew
are specializations of the transform function.
