\page signal_func_conv_desc Convolution

A convolution is a common operation between a source array, a, and a filter (or kernel) array b.
The answer to the convolution is the same as computing the coefficients in polynomial multiplication,
if a and b are the coefficients.

Another way to think about it is that the filter kernel is centered on each pixel in a,
and the output for that pixel or data point is the sum of the products.

Depending on the dimensions of the input signal and the filter signal, any one of the following
batch mode convolutions take place.

- **No Batch**   - Single filter applied to single input.
- **Filter is Batched**  - Many filters applied on same input
- **Signal is Batched**  - Single filter applied to a set of inputs.
- **Identical Batches** - A set of filters applied onto to a set of inputs in one-to-one correspondence.
- **Non overlapping Batches** - All batched filters are applied to all batched signals. The batch dimension of Signal and Filter **should not** be the same.

For example, if the signal is two dimensional with m & n as sizes along the 0th & 1st dimensions
respectively, then the possible batch operations are as follows.

| Input Signal Dimensions | Filter Dimensions | Output Dimensions | Batch Mode | Explanation |
|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|:------------|
| [m n 1 1] | [m n 1 1] | [m n 1 1] | No Batch  | Output will be a single convolve array |
| [m n 1 1] | [m n p 1] | [m n p 1] | Filter is Batched | p filters applied to same input |
| [m n p 1] | [m n 1 1] | [m n p 1] | Signal is Batched | 1 filter applied to p inputs |
| [m n p 1] | [m n p 1] | [m n p 1] | Identical Batches | p filters applied to p inputs in one-to-one correspondence |
| [m n p 1] | [m n 1 q] | [m n p q] | Non-overlapping batches | q filters applied to p inputs in to produce p x q results |

\page signal_func_fft_desc fft

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) of a signal or array. This is most commonly used to convert data in the
time (or space) domain to the frequency domain, Then, the inverse FFT (iFFT) is used to
return the data to the original domain.

There are numerous algorithms to compute the FFT of an array, and the specifics of the
algorithm depend on the target hardware. Most algorithms, however, use a Cooley-Tukey
scheme in a divide-and-conquer approach.

\note There are some convenience functions provided for fft where normalization
factor is not required as input paramter. In such cases, the normalization
factor is calculated internally based on the input data provided.
