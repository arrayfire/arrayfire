Debugging ArrayFire Issues {#debugging}
===============================================================================

Some general advice for debugging mysterious issues with ArrayFire follows.

First, try running with additional debugging information:

    export AF_PRINT_ERRORS=1           #Make exceptions more helpful
    export AF_TRACE=all                #Print all the stuff
    #export AF_TRACE=mem               #Print memory management allocation, free, and garbage collection information
    #export AF_TRACE=unified           #Print unified backend dynamic loading information
    #export AF_TRACE=mem,unified       #Print both of the above
    export AF_JIT_KERNEL_TRACE=kernels #Write out the source code generated by the JIT to the directory `kernels`
    ./my_program                       #Run program with the above

Next, add some debugging output to your code.

C++:

    af_print_mem_info("message", -1); //-1 is the active device; otherwise, an integer specifies a device

Python:

    arrayfire.device.print_mem_info("message")
