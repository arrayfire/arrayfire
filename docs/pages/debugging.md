===============================================================================

Using Environment Variables
---------------------------

 * `AF_PRINT_ERRORS=1`: Makes exceptions more helpful
 * `AF_TRACE=all`: Shows what ArrayFire is doing
 * `AF_JIT_KERNEL_TRACE=kernels`: Writes out source code generated by ArrayFire's JIT to the directory `kernels`



Tips in Language Bindings
-------------------------

### C++

* `af_print_mem_info("message", -1);`: Print table of memory used by ArrayFire on the active GPU

### Python

* `arrayfire.device.print_mem_info("message")`: Print table of memory used by ArrayFire on the active GPU
