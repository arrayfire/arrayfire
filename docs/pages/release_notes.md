  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1687)</sup>

Known issues
------------

* Windows
  * The Windows NVIDIA driver version `37x.xx` contains a bug which causes
    `fftconvolve_opencl` to fail. Upgrade or downgrade to a different version of
    the driver to avoid this failure.
  * The following tests fail on Windows with NVIDIA hardware:
    `threading_cuda`,`qr_dense_opencl`, `solve_dense_opencl`.
* macOS
  * The Accelerate framework, used by the CPU backend on macOS, leverages Intel
    graphics cards (Iris) when there are no discrete GPUs available. This OpenCL
    implementation is known to give incorrect results on the following tests:
    `lu_dense_{cpu,opencl}`, `solve_dense_{cpu,opencl}`,
    `inverse_dense_{cpu,opencl}`.
  * Certain tests intermittently fail on macOS with NVIDIA GPUs apparently due
    to inconsistent driver behavior: `fft_large_cuda` and `svd_dense_cuda`.
  * The following tests are currently failing on macOS with AMD GPUs:
    `cholesky_dense_opencl` and `scan_by_key_opencl`.


v3.4.2
==============

Deprecation Announcement
------------------------

This release supports CUDA 6.5 and higher. The next ArrayFire relase will
support CUDA 7.0 and higher, dropping support for CUDA 6.5. Reasons for no
longer supporting CUDA 6.5 include:

* CUDA 7.0 NVCC supports the C++11 standard (whereas CUDA 6.5 does not), which
  is used by ArrayFire's CPU and OpenCL backends.
* Very few ArrayFire users still use CUDA 6.5.

As a result, the older Jetson TK1 / Tegra K1 will no longer be supported in
the next ArrayFire release. The newer Jetson TX1 / Tegra X1 will continue to
have full capability with ArrayFire.

Docker
------
* [ArrayFire has been Dockerized](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-docker).

Improvements
------------
* Implemented sparse storage format conversions between \ref AF_STORAGE_CSR
  and \ref AF_STORAGE_COO.
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1642)</sup>
  * Directly convert between \ref AF_STORAGE_COO <--> \ref AF_STORAGE_CSR
    using the af::sparseConvertTo() function.
  * af::sparseConvertTo() now also supports converting to dense.
* Added cast support for [sparse arrays](\ref sparse_func).
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1653)</sup>
  * Casting only changes the values array and the type. The row and column
    index arrays are not changed.
* Reintroduced automated computation of chart axes limits for graphics functions.
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1639)</sup>
  * The axes limits will always be the minimum/maximum of the current and new
    limit.
  * The user can still set limits from API calls. If the user sets a limit
    from the API call, then the automatic limit setting will be disabled.
* Using `boost::scoped_array` instead of `boost::scoped_ptr` when managing
  array resources.
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1637)</sup>
* Internal performance improvements to getInfo() by using `const` references
  to avoid unnecessary copying of `ArrayInfo` objects.
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1665)</sup>
* Added support for scalar af::array inputs for af::convolve() and
  [set functions](\ref set_mat).
  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/issues/1660)</sup>
  <sup>[2](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/issues/1675)</sup>
  <sup>[3](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/pull/1668)</sup>
* Performance fixes in af::fftConvolve() kernels.

  <sup>[1](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/issues/1664)</sup>

Known Issues
------------
* Known failures with CUDA 6.5. These include all functions that use
  sorting. As a result, sparse storage format conversion between \ref
  AF_STORAGE_COO and \ref AF_STORAGE_CSR has been disabled for CUDA 6.5.
