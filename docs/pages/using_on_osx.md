Using ArrayFire on OSX {#using_on_osx}
=====

Once you have [installed](\ref installing) ArrayFire on your system, the next
thing to do is set up your build system.
On OSX, you may create ArrayFire project using almost any editor, compiler,
or build system.
The only requirement is that you can include the ArrayFire header directory,
and link with the ArrayFire library you intend to use.

## The big picture

By default, the ArrayFire OSX installer will place several files in your
computer's `/usr/local` directory.
The installer will populate this directory with files in the following
sub-directories:

    include/arrayfire.h         - Primary ArrayFire include file
    include/af/*.h              - Additional include files
    lib/libaf*                  - CPU, CUDA, and OpenCL libraries (.a, .so)
    lib/libforge*               - Visualization library
    share/ArrayFire/cmake/*     - CMake config (find) scripts
    share/ArrayFire/examples/*  - All ArrayFire examples

Because ArrayFire follows standard installation practices, you can use basically
any build system to create and compile projects that use ArrayFire.
Among the many possible build systems on Linux we suggest using ArrayFire with
either CMake or Makefiles with CMake being our preferred build system.

## XCode

Although we recommend using CMake to build ArrayFire projects on OSX, you can
use XCode if this is your preferred development platform.
To save some time, we have created an sample XCode project in our 
[ArrayFire Project Templates repository](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-project-templates).

To set up a basic C/C++ project in XCode do the following:

1. Start up XCode. Choose OSX -> Application, Command Line Tool for the project:
<img src="xcode-setup/xcode-startup.png" alt="Create a command line too XCode Project" width="100%" />

2. Fill in the details for your project and choose either C or C++ for the project:
<img src="xcode-setup/project-options.png" alt="Create a C/C++ project" width="100%" />

3. Next we need to configure the build settings. In the left-hand pane, click
   on the project. In the center pane, click on "Build Settings" followed by
   the "All" button:
<img src="xcode-setup/build-settings.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

4. Now search for "Header Search Paths" and add `/usr/local/include` to the list:
<img src="xcode-setup/header-search-paths.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

5. Then search for "Library Search Paths" and add `/usr/local/lib` to the list:
<img src="xcode-setup/library-search-paths.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

6. Next, we need to make sure the executable is linked with an ArrayFire library:
   To do this, click the "Build Phases" tab and expand the "Link with Binary Library"
   menu:
<img src="xcode-setup/build-phases.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

7. In the search dialog that pops up, choose the "Add Other" button from the
   lower right. Specify the `/usr/local/lib` folder:
<img src="xcode-setup/library-folder-path.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

8. Lastly, select the ArrayFire library with which you wish to link your program.
  Your options will be:

~~~~~
libafcuda.*.dylib   - CUDA backend
libafopencl.*.dylib - OpenCL backend
libafcpu.*.dylib    - CPU backend
libaf.*.dylib       - Unified backend
~~~~~

In the picture below, we have elected to link with the OpenCL backend:

<img src="xcode-setup/pick-arrayfire-library.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

9. Lastly, lets test ArrayFire's functionality. In the left hand pane open
   the main.cpp` file and insert the following code:

~~~~~
// Include the ArrayFire header file
#include <arrayfire.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    // Gather some information about the ArrayFire device
    af::info();
    return 0;
}
~~~~~

Finally, click the build button and you should see some information about your
graphics card in the lower-section of your screen:

<img src="xcode-setup/afinfo-result.png" alt="Configure build settings" width="100%" />

## CMake

We recommend that the CMake build system be used to create ArrayFire projects.
If you are writing a new ArrayFire project in C/C++ from scratch, we suggest
you grab a copy of our
[CMake Project Example](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-project-templates);
however, it is useful to read the documentation below in case you need to add
ArrayFire to an existing project.

As [discussed above](#big-picture), ArrayFire ships with a series of CMake
scripts to make finding and using our library easy.
The scripts will automatically find all versions of the ArrayFire library
and pick the most powerful of the installed backends (typically CUDA).

First create a file called `CMakeLists.txt` in your project directory:

    cd your-project-directory
    touch CMakeLists.txt

and populate it with the following code:

    FIND_PACKAGE(ArrayFire)
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${ArrayFire_INCLUDE_DIRS})

    ... [gather source files, etc.]

    # If you intend to use OpenCL, you need to find it
    FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCL)
    SET(EXTRA_LIBS ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT} ${OpenCL_LIBRARIES})

    # Or if you intend to use CUDA, you need it as well as NVVM:
    FIND_PACKAGE(CUDA)
    FIND_PACKAGE(NVVM) # this FIND script can be found in the ArrayFire CMake example repository
    SET(EXTRA_LIBS ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT} ${CUDA_LIBRARIES} ${NVVM_LIB})

    ADD_EXECUTABLE(my_executable [list your source files here])
    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(my_executable ${ArrayFire_LIBRARIES} ${EXTRA_LIBS})

where `my_executable` is the name of the executable you wish to create.
See the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for more
information on how to use CMake.
Clearly the above code snippet precludes the use of both CUDA and OpenCL, see
the
[ArrayFire CMake Example](https://github.com/bkloppenborg/arrayfire-cmake-example)
for an example of how to build executables for both backends from the same
CMake script.

In the above code listing, the `FIND_PACKAGE` will find the ArrayFire include
files, libraries, and define several variables including:

    ArrayFire_INCLUDE_DIRS    - Location of ArrayFire's include directory.
    ArrayFire_LIBRARIES       - Location of ArrayFire's libraries.
                                This will default to a GPU backend if one
                                is found
    ArrayFire_FOUND           - True if ArrayFire has been located

If you wish to use a specific backend, the find script also defines these variables:

    ArrayFire_CPU_FOUND         - True of the ArrayFire CPU library has been found.
    ArrayFire_CPU_LIBRARIES     - Location of ArrayFire's CPU library, if found
    ArrayFire_CUDA_FOUND        - True of the ArrayFire CUDA library has been found.
    ArrayFire_CUDA_LIBRARIES    - Location of ArrayFire's CUDA library, if found
    ArrayFire_OpenCL_FOUND      - True of the ArrayFire OpenCL library has been found.
    ArrayFire_OpenCL_LIBRARIES  - Location of ArrayFire's OpenCL library, if found
    ArrayFire_Unified_FOUND     - True of the ArrayFire Unified library has been found.
    ArrayFire_Unified_LIBRARIES - Location of ArrayFire's Unified library, if found

Therefore, if you wish to target a specific specific backend, simply replace
`${ArrayFire_LIBRARIES}` with `${ArrayFire_CPU}`, `${ArrayFire_OPENCL}`,
`${ArrayFire_CUDA}`, or `${ArrayFire_Unified}` in the `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`
command above.
If you intend on building your software to link with all of these backends,
please see the
[CMake Project Example](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-project-templates)
which makes use of some fairly fun CMake tricks to avoid re-compiling code
whenever possible.

Next we need to instruct CMake to create build instructions and then compile.
We suggest using CMake's out-of-source build functionality to keep your build
and source files cleanly separated. To do this:

    cd your-project-directory
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

*NOTE:* If you have installed ArrayFire to a non-standard location, CMake can
still help you out. When you execute CMake specify the path to the
`ArrayFireConfig*` files that are found in the `share/ArrayFire/cmake`
subdirectory of the installation folder.
For example, if ArrayFire were installed locally to `/opt/ArrayFire` then you
would modify the `cmake` command above to contain the following definition:

    cmake -DArrayFire_DIR=/opt/ArrayFire/share/ArrayFire/cmake ..

You can also specify this information in the ccmake command-line interface.

## MakeFiles

Building ArrayFire projects with Makefiles is fairly similar to CMake except
you must specify all paths and libraries manually.
As with any make project, you need to specify the include path to the
directory containing `arrayfire.h` file.
This should be `-I /usr/local/include` if you followed our installation
instructions.
Similarly, you will need to specify the path to the ArrayFire library using
the `-L` option (e.g. `-L/usr/local/lib`) followed by the specific ArrayFire
library you wish to use using the `-l` option (for example `-lafcpu`,
`-lafopencl`, `-lafcuda`, or `-laf` for the CPU, OpenCL, CUDA, and unified
backends respectively.

Here is a minimial example MakeFile which uses ArrayFire's CPU backend:

    LIBS=-lafcpu
    LIB_PATHS=-L/usr/lib
    INCLUDES=-I/usr/include
    CC=g++ $(COMPILER_OPTIONS)
    COMPILER_OPTIONS=-std=c++11 -g

    all: main.cpp Makefile
        $(CC) main.cpp -o test $(INCLUDES) $(LIBS) $(LIB_PATHS)
